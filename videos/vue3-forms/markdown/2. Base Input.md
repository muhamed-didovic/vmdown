# Base Input

## Our Demo Form

Throughout this course, we’re building a set of reusable base form components and exploring best practices along the way. In order to build these, we’ll want a demo form to use as a starting point, which we’ll break apart into these base component. I’ve prepared one so that we can jump right into it.

The form already includes `v-model` bindings into a `reactive` state and a `categories` array to power the `select` element.

📃**SimpleForm.vue**

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Create an event</h1>
    <form>

      <label>Select a category</label>
      <select v-model="event.category">
        <option
          v-for="option in categories"
          :value="option"
          :key="option"
          :selected="option === event.category"
        >{{ option }}</option>
      </select>

      <h3>Name & describe your event</h3>

      <label>Title</label>
      <input
        v-model="event.title"
        type="text"
        placeholder="Title"
        class="field"
      >

      <label>Description</label>
      <input
        v-model="event.description"
        type="text"
        placeholder="Description"
        class="field"
      />

      <h3>Where is your event?</h3>

      <label>Location</label>
      <input
        v-model="event.location"
        type="text"
        placeholder="Location"
        class="field"
      />

      <h3>Are pets allowed?</h3>
      <div>
        <input
            type="radio"
            v-model="event.pets"
            :value="1"
            name="pets"
          />
        <label>Yes</label>
      </div>

      <div>
        <input
          type="radio"
          v-model="event.pets"
          :value="0"
          name="pets"
        />
        <label>No</label>
      </div>

      <h3>Extras</h3>
      <div>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          v-model="event.extras.catering"
          class="field"
        />
        <label>Catering</label>
      </div>

      <div>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          v-model="event.extras.music"
          class="field"
        />
        <label>Live music</label>
      </div>

      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      categories: [
        'sustainability',
        'nature',
        'animal welfare',
        'housing',
        'education',
        'food',
        'community'
      ],
      event: {
        category: '',
        title: '',
        description: '',
        location: '',
        pets: 1,
        extras: {
          catering: false,
          music: false
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</script>

# The Base Input

The goal of this lesson is to create a BaseInput component. Whenever we are building forms in Vue, creating reusable components for each specific input type will allow us to easily replicate them, modify them and also extend them. This also ensures that throughout our application forms will be consistent.

Let’s get started by creating the file `BaseInput.vue` in our `components` folder.

We’ll start by copying the `input` element with its `label`, just as they currently are in the demo form, and paste that into the new component’s template - we’re going to transform this static code into something more reusable and flexible. After all, that’s the benefit of making components!

📃**BaseInput.vue**

```html
<template>
  <label>Title</label>
  <input
    v-model="event.title"
    type="text"
    placeholder="Title"
    class="field"
  >
</template>

```

In Vue 3 we can have multiple root nodes. This means we can have the `label` and `input` at root level without needing to wrap them in a single root element like a `div`, like we had to in Vue 2.

The first thing we need to do is allow our component to receive a `label` from the parent. To do this, we are going to create a `label` prop. This prop will be used not only for our label, but also as a placeholder - so it is very convenient that we only have to define it once in the parent.

Let’s go ahead and add the `label` property in the `script` section of our component.

📃**BaseInput.vue**

```html
<script>
export default {
  props: {
    label: {
      type: String,
      default: ''
    }
  }
}
</script>

```

Now we can use our new `label` property through interpolation inside our template’s `label` element.

📃**BaseInput.vue**

```html
<template>
  <label>{{ label }}</label>
  <input
    v-model="event.title"
    type="text"
    placeholder="Title"
    class="field"
  >
</template>

```

While we’re at it, we’re going to delete the `v-model` directive since we’re no longer going to be using it inside the component. We’ll come back to using `v-model` later on.

We will also delete `type`, because it will be provided as part of the attributes by the parent — remember that we want to keep the component as flexible as possible.

The user of this component may want to make it of type `email` or `password`, and the default for input is already of type `text`, if not declared.

Finally, let’s bind the `placeholder` attribute to our `label` property as well. This will make sure that both the “hint” text inside the input and the actual label are coordinated and reactive.

📃**BaseInput.vue**

```html
<template>
  <label v-if="label">{{ label }}</label>
  <input
    class="field"
    :placeholder="label"
  >
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: {
    label: {
      type: String,
      default: ''
    }
  }
}
</script>

```

---

## v-model: Binding to the value

Now that our component has its basic structure, we can move on to adding the capability for our component to be `v-model` ready.

By default in Vue 3, `v-model` expects a property named `modelValue` to be on your v-model-capable component. Let’s go ahead and add this new property, and then bind it to the `value` attribute of our `input`.

We will default it to an empty string, but will specify `String` and `Number` as the allowed types.

There is a good chance that the parent may try to bind either a text or string like `Hello` to our input, but it may also try to bind a numeric value, like the user’s age or `30` \- we need to be able to allow either to be set.

📃**BaseInput.vue**

```html
<template>
  <label v-if="label">{{ label }}</label>
  <input
    :value="modelValue"
    :placeholder="label"
    class="field"
  >
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: {
    label: {
      type: String,
      default: ''
    },  
    modelValue: {
      type: [String, Number],
      default: ''
    }
  }
}
</script>

```

Now that we have our `modelValue` property set and bound to the `input` attribute of the input element, let’s look at the second part of the `v-model` two-way binding: emitting an event.

---

## v-model: Emitting the `update:modelValue` event

All components that are capable of being `v-modeled` have to emit an event in order for the parent to be able to catch the updates to that component’s data.

In Vue 3, by default all `v-model` contracts expect for your component to emit an `update:modelValue` event, regardless of what type of input, or inputs, your component contains.

Let’s go ahead and add an `input` event listener to our `<input/>` element, and `emit` an `update:modelValue` event whenever an input event occurs.

📃**BaseInput.vue**

```html
<template>
  <label v-if="label">{{ label }}</label>
  <input
    :value="modelValue"
    :placeholder="label"
    @input="$emit('update:modelValue', $event.target.value)"
    class="field"
  >
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: {
    label: {
      type: 'String',
      default: ''
    },  
    modelValue: {
      type: [String, Number],
      default: ''
    }
  }
}
</script>

```

Adding an `@input` listener to our `input` element allows us to fire-off the required event every time the user types something into the input field.

Notice that we are passing the event’s target value (`$event.target.value`)as the payload of the event. This is the value that the `v-model` will receive on the parent.

Speaking of the parent, let’s go back to our form and use our new `BaseInput` component instead of our native elements to test out our code. Let’s replace the **Title, Description and Location** inputs in our form with our new component.

📃**App.vue**

```html
<form>
  <label>Select a category</label>
  <select v-model="event.category">
    <option
      v-for="option in categories"
      :value="option"
      :key="option"
      :selected="option === event.category"
    >{{ option }}</option>
  </select>

  <h3>Name & describe your event</h3>

  <BaseInput
    v-model="event.title"
    label="Title"
    type="text"
  />

  <BaseInput
    v-model="event.description"
    label="Description"
    type="text"
  />

  <h3>Where is your event?</h3>

  <BaseInput
    v-model="event.location"
    label="Location"
    type="text"
  />

  <h3>Are pets allowed?</h3>
  <div>
    <input
        type="radio"
        v-model="event.pets"
        :value="1"
        name="pets"
      />
    <label>Yes</label>
  </div>

  <div>
    <input
      type="radio"
      v-model="event.pets"
      :value="0"
      name="pets"
    />
    <label>No</label>
  </div>

  <h3>Extras</h3>
  <div>
    <input
      type="checkbox"
      v-model="event.extras.catering"
      class="field"
    />
    <label>Catering</label>
  </div>

  <div>
    <input
      type="checkbox"
      v-model="event.extras.music"
      class="field"
    />
    <label>Live music</label>
  </div>

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

```

Our components seem to be “working”, but there seems to be a problem with the styles.

If we inspect the component further, it seems that our `type` attribute is nowhere to be found. We want to be able to assign attributes like `type` into the component’s input when we set them on the instance in the parent.

Let’s take a look at how to achieve this.

---

## Assigning the $attrs to the input

In Vue, whenever you pass down attributes, classes and styles from a parent to a child like we are doing with the `type` in our `BaseInput` component, Vue will attempt to automatically figure out where inside your template these attributes should be injected.

In components with a single wrapping element, also known as single root components, this behavior is very straightforward. Vue will simply inject all the attributes, classes and styles into the root element.

In multi-root components, such as our `BaseInput`, Vue can’t figure out without our help which one of the nodes, or fragments, it should inject the attributes to — so Vue simply gives up and issues a warning.

In the case of our `BaseInput` component, we want to be able to inject attributes directly into the `input`, so we have to manually bind the `$attrs` object to it. Let’s go ahead and do that now by adding `v-bind="$attrs”` to our input element.

```html
<input
  v-bind="$attrs"
  :value="modelValue"
  :placeholder="label"
  @input="$emit('update:modelValue', $event.target.value)"
  class="field"
>

```

With this small change, the `input` elements will now correctly receive the `type` binding from the parent, and our CSS classes will be applied.

## Coming up next

In this lesson we learned how to build our first form component, the `BaseInput`, and how to correctly create a component that is `v-model` ready.

Did you notice that we never actually imported the `BaseInput` component before we used it on our form? Don’t worry about that bit for now, in lesson 4 we’ll go through the bit of magic that goes on behind the scenes to accomplish thi

In our next lesson, we’re going to build our next component, the `BaseSelect`.

See you there!
