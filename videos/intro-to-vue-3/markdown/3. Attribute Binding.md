# Attribute Binding

In this lesson, weâ€™re going to look at the concept of attribute binding. If youâ€™re coding along with the repo, you can checkout the `L3-start` branch or the [starting code](https://codepen.io/VueMastery/project/editor/ZWEjLe) on Codepen.

## Our Goal

In the starting code, we have a new `div` with the class of `product-image`.

ðŸ“„**index.html**

```html
<div class="product-image">
  <!-- image goes here -->
</div>

```

By the end of the lesson, weâ€™re going to have an `img` element here that is reactively bound to a new `image` property on our data. Whenever the value of that image changes, our image will update in the DOM.

---

## Adding an image to our data

Remember in our **assets** directory we have an **images** folder, with images for green and blue socks? Letâ€™s target one of those images from a new data property on our Vue app. Weâ€™ll do so by setting `image` equal to a path so it can grab that image.

ðŸ“„**main.js**

```javascript
const app = Vue.createApp({
    data() {
        return {
            product: 'Socks',
            image: './assets/images/socks_green.jpg'
        }
    }
})

```

Now weâ€™re ready to add an `img` element in the template.

ðŸ“„**index.html**

```html
<div class="product-image">
  <img src="image">
</div>

```

In the source attribute, weâ€™ll say `image`. Right now, this wonâ€™t do anything. We want `src` to pull in the `image` path from our data, similar to how we pulled in the `product` data value in the `h1` expression in the previous lesson.

So the question here is: **How do we bind the `src` attribute to the `image` data?**

---

## Introducing Attribute Binding

To create a bond between an HTML elementâ€™s attribute and a value from your Vue appâ€™s data, weâ€™ll use a Vue directive called `v-bind`.

ðŸ“„**index.html**

```html
<img v-bind:src="image">

```

Now, weâ€™ve created a reactive bond between what lives in this attribute (`"image"`) and the `image` data itself.

Looking in the browser, weâ€™ll now see our green socks image displaying.

## Understanding v-bind

How exactly is the `v-bind` directive working? We use this directive to dynamically bind an attribute to an expression. In this case, the attribute is `src` and the expression is whatever is in that attributeâ€™s quotes: `"image"`

ðŸ“„**index.html**

```html
<img v-bind:src="image"> <! -- src attribute bound to the image data -->

```

If youâ€™re thinking this doesnâ€™t look like a typical JavaScript expression, you can imagine it looking like this: `v-bind:src="{{ image }}"`. Under the hood, Vue is going to evaluate it just the same.

---

## A Reactive Bond

Because of Vueâ€™s reactivity system, if we updated our `image` data to a path that points to the image of our blue socks (`image: './assets/images/socks_blue.jpg'`), the expression that our `src` attribute is bound to would update and our browser would display the blue socks image.

---

## A shorthand for v-bind

Using `v-bind` is super commonâ€”so common that there is a shorthand for it, and itâ€™s just the colon, like so:

```html
<img :src="image"> 

```

As you can imagine, since thereâ€™s so many different HTML attributes, there are many use cases for `v-bind`. For example, you might be binding a description to an `alt` attribute, binding a URL to an `href`, binding some dynamic styles to a `class` or `style` attribute, disabling and enabling a button, and so on.

## Coding Challenge

Weâ€™ve reached the end of the lesson and weâ€™re onto our second challenge:

**Add a `url` to the data object**

**Bind the `url` to an anchor tagâ€™s `href` attribute**

As a reminder, if youâ€™re coding along with our repo, you can check out `L3-end` branch, and you can view the [solution code](https://codepen.io/VueMastery/project/editor/AqemLM) on Codepen.
