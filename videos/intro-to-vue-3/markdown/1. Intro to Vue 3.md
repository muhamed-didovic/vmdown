# Intro to Vue 3

Welcome to Vue Mastery’s Intro to Vue 3 course. We’re going to take a journey through the Vue universe to explore the technology and build a solid foundation of new skills, so we can build upon that to head towards Vue mastery. This course is your first step along the way, and on our platform you’ll find a whole [library of courses](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses) you can take to level-up your skills.

Throughout this course, we’ll learn the fundamentals of Vue.js and build an app to put these concepts in practice.

To get the most out of this course, you’re going to want to be coding along. And there’s two ways to do that, depending on your experience level. If you’re newer to programming, you’re going to want to click on the link below this video that takes you over to our Codepen account.

There, you’ll find our [starting code](https://codepen.io/VueMastery/project/editor/AYQBOw), which you can fork to your personal account. However, with the free CodePen account, you can only have one project at a time. So if you already have a project in your account, you’re going to have to delete it out to make a new one for this course, which you build upon each lesson.

If you have more experience with programming and using git, and Github, you’re going to want to head over to the [course’s repo](https://github.com/Code-Pop/Intro-to-Vue-3) and clone the project. From there, you can switch between different branches for the starting and ending code for each lesson. For example, in the next lesson (lesson two) you can check out `L2-start` or `L2-end` for the starting and ending code, respectively.

Throughout this course, you’re going to see me using VS code. I do recommend this code editor for Vue development, but if you already have a code editor of your choice, you can stick with that one. If you want to use VS code and you don’t already have it, you’re going to want to [download it now](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and also install an extension [es6-string-html](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tobermory.es6-string-html). You’ll see why this extension will be useful in later lessons.

Finally, at the end of each lesson, you’ll see a coding challenge so you can put the concepts into practice. Now, if you’re ready, let’s create our first Vue app in the next lesson.
