# Conditional Rendering

In this lesson, we’re going to look at the concept of conditional rendering. If you’re coding along with the repo, you can checkout the `L4-start` branch or use the [starting code](https://codepen.io/VueMastery/project/editor/AayWgg) on Codepen.

## Our Goal

We want to display different HTML elements based upon a condition. We’ll display a `p` tag that says “in stock” when our product is in stock, or one that says “out of stock” when it’s not.

---

## To render or not to render

In our index.html file, we’ll add two new `p` tags.

📄**index.html**

```html
<p>In Stock</p>
<p>Out of Stock</p>

```

We only want one of these to show up depending on if our product is in stock or not, so we’ll head into our Vue app’s data object and add a new `inStock` boolean.

📄**main.js**

```javascript
const app = Vue.createApp({
    data() {
        return {
            product: 'Socks',
            image: './assets/images/socks_blue.jpg',
            inStock: true // new data property //
        }
    }
})

```

Now that we’ve added the elements we want to conditionally render, and the condition (`inStock`) that we’ll use to decide which one to render, we’re ready to learn about another Vue directive.

---

## The v-if directive

We can add the `v-if` directive onto an element to render it based upon a condition, like so:

```html
<p v-if="inStock">In Stock</p>

```

Now, this element will render only _if_ `inStock` is truthy.

We can combine the `v-if` directive with its sister directive `v-else` to display another element as the fallback if the first condition turns out to be falsey.

📄**index.html**

```html
<p v-if="inStock">In Stock</p>
<p v-else>Out of Stock</p>

```

Now, if `inStock` is `false`, we’ll see “Out of Stock” gets rendered to the page.

---

## Show and Hide

It’s worth noting that you don’t always need to pair `v-if` with `v-else`. There are plenty of use cases where you don’t need a fallback element to render. However, in these cases, it is sometimes a better option to use the `v-show` directive.

📄**index.html**

```html
<p v-show="inStock">In Stock</p>

```

The `v-show` directive is used for toggling an element’s **visibility** instead of adding and removing the element from the DOM entirely, like `v-if` does.

As you might imagine, this is a more performant option if you have something that’s toggling off and on the screen often. We can verify this by setting `inStock` to `false` and viewing the element in the browser’s Developer Tools. When `v-show` is used, we can see that the element is still present in the DOM, but it’s now hidden with an inline style of `display: none;` added to it.

## Chained Conditional Logic

Earlier, we looked at `v-if` with `v-else`, now let’s take a look at how we can add additional layers of conditional logic.

To do this, we’ll replace `inStock` with `inventory`:

📄**main.js**

```javascript
const app = Vue.createApp({
    data() {
        return {
            ...
            inventory: 100 
    }

```

Since our condition (`inventory`) is now an integer, we can use a bit more complex logic within our expression. For example:

📄**index.html**

```html
<p v-if="inventory > 10">In Stock</p>
<p v-else>Out of Stock</p>

```

Now, we will only render the first `p` tag if `inventory` is greater than `10`.

Let’s say we want display a new message when the product is almost sold out. In this situation, we could add another conditional level, where we’re watching out for `inventory` to get below `10` but above `0`.

📄**index.html**

```html
<p v-if="inventory > 10">In Stock</p>
<p v-else-if="inventory <= 10 && inventory > 0">Almost sold out!</p>
<p v-else>Out of Stock</p>

```

The `v-else-if` directive gives us a middle layer of logic. So in this example, if `inventory` were `8`, this `p` tag would get rendered.

Of course, if `inventory` is zero, we’ll default to the final level of `v-else` and display “Out of stock”.

## Coding Challenge

We’ve reached the end of the lesson and we’re onto our challenge:

Add an `onSale` Boolean to the data object.

Use `onSale` to conditionally render a `p` tag that says “On Sale,” whenever `onSale` is `true`.

As a reminder, if you’re coding along with our repo, you can check out `L4-end` branch, and you can view the [solution code](https://codepen.io/VueMastery/project/editor/XqemMd) on Codepen.
