# List Rendering

In this lesson, weâ€™re going to look at the concept of list binding. If youâ€™re coding along with the repo, you can checkout the `L5-start` branch or view the [starting code](https://codepen.io/VueMastery/project/editor/XLjywE) on Codepen.

## Our Goal

Render HTML lists from an array in our data.

---

## Looping through data arrays

In the starting code, we now have an array of `details`.

ðŸ“„**main.js**

```javascript
const app = Vue.createApp({
    data() {
        return {
            ...
            details: ['50% cotton', '30% wool', '20% polyester']
        }
    }
})

```

The question now is: how do we display this data as a list?

Weâ€™ll start by creating an unordered list in our **index.html**. On the `li` inside of it, weâ€™ll add another Vue directive: `v-for`

ðŸ“„**index.html**

```html
<ul>
  <li v-for="detail in details">{{ detail }}</li>
</ul>

```

Inside the `v-for` expression, we wrote: `detail in details`. Here, `details` refers to the `details` array in our data, and `detail` is the alias for the current element from that array, as weâ€™re looping through it to print out a new `li`.

Each `li` will display that array element because in the inner HTML weâ€™ve written an expression: `{{ detail }}` to print out each detail.

If we check the browser, weâ€™ll see a list of the `details` is displayed.

So far so good, but how is `v-for` actually working?

## Product Variant Colors

To get more familiar with list rendering with `v-for`, weâ€™ll work on another example within our app. Letâ€™s add a new `variants` array to our data:

ðŸ“„**main.js**

```javascript
data() {
  return {
    ...
    variants: [
      { id: 2234, color: 'green' },
      { id: 2235, color: 'blue' }
    ]
  }
}

```

We now have an array that contains an object for each variant of our product. Each product variant has an `id`, and a `color`. So for our next task, weâ€™ll print out each variant color, and use the `id` to help Vue keep track of our list items.

ðŸ“„**index.html**

```html
<div v-for="variant in variants" :key="variant.id">{{ variant.color }}</div>

```

Notice how weâ€™re using dot notation to print out each `variant` as we loop through the `variants` array. But what is that `:key` attribute doing there?

---

## Key Attribute: An essential for list items

By saying `:key="variant.id"`, weâ€™re using the shorthand for `v-bind` to bind the variantâ€™s `id` to the `key` attribute. This gives each DOM element a unique key so that Vue can grasp onto the element and not lose track of it as things update within the app.

This provides some performance improvements, and later down the line, if youâ€™re doing something like animating your elements, youâ€™ll find that the `key` attribute really helps Vue effectively manage your elements as they move around the DOM.

## Coding Challenge

Weâ€™ve reached the end of the lesson and weâ€™re onto our challenge:

**Add an array of `sizes` to the data object.**

**Use `v-for` to display the `sizes` in a list.**

As a reminder, if youâ€™re coding along with our repo, you can check out `L5-end` branch, and you can view the [solution code](https://codepen.io/VueMastery/project/editor/XoMWKj) on Codepen.
