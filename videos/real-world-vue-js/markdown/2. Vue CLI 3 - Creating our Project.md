# Vue CLI 3 - Creating our Project

In this tutorial, we’ll be exploring Vue CLI 3, along with the Vue UI, in order to quickly scaffold our project. We’ll then take a tour of the project the CLI creates for us to get comfortable working within these files and folders later.

## Why a CLI?

As you probably know, CLI stands for Command Line Interface, and the Vue CLI provides a full system for rapid Vue.js development. This means it does a lot of tedious work for us and provides us with valuable features out-of-the-box.

**It allows us to select which libraries our project will be using**Then it automatically plugs them into the project.

**It Configures Webpack**When we build our app with Webpack, all of our JavaScript files, our CSS, and our dependencies get properly bundled together, minified and optimized.

**It allows us to write our HTML, CSS & JavaScript however we like**We can use single-file .vue components, TypeScript, SCSS, Pug, the latest versions of ECMAScript, etc.

**It enables Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**So when you save your project, changes appear instantly in the browser. This configuration is based on [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server).

---

## Installing the CLI

In order to use the CLI, you’ll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 8 or above installed (8.10.0+ is recommended).

To install the CLI, run this command in your terminal:

```
    npm i -g @vue/cli

```

Once it is installed, you’ll have access to the `vue` binary in your command line. We’ll use this to create our project.

## Creating a Vue project

There are two ways we can create our project. With the newer Vue UI, or directly from the command line, which we’ll do now with:

```
    vue create real-world-vue

```

This command will start the creation of a Vue project, with the name of “real-world-vue”.

We’ll then be prompted with the option to pick a default preset or to manually select features. Using the down arrow key, we’ll highlight **Manually select features**, then hit enter.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578380508167_0.png?alt=media&token=346f1dcd-211f-41a6-81da-69a2f2bdc1b4)

We’ll then be presented with a list of feature options. Using the down arrow key, we’ll move down and use the spacebar to select **Router**, **Vuex** and **Linter / Formatter**. Then hit enter.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370454974_1.png?alt=media&token=dacad019-cc52-4b46-8620-7d697aa634f3)

We’ll then choose a Linter / Formatter. For this project, we’ll be using **ESLint + Prettier**.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370454975_2.png?alt=media&token=c6918534-9a95-4393-82c2-990c58dc6750)

We’ll add the additional feature of **Lint on save**.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370460364_3.png?alt=media&token=4717ec0a-be7f-48a4-8a6f-9c9e5f5d5610)

And for the sake of this course, we’ll choose to have dedicated config files.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370465198_4.png?alt=media&token=8564bb93-b700-4618-bc24-ec14d94abddb)

We have the option to save all of these settings as a preset. We’ll choose not to with `N`.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370465199_5.png?alt=media&token=7266d246-f949-49af-9235-7e03c0736fea)

If you’d like to save this as a preset, however, it will be stored in a JSON file named `.vuerc` in your user home directory.

If you have yarn installed, you’ll be prompted to choose a package manager. I’ll choose [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

When we hit enter, our project will be created automatically.

## Serving our Project

Once our project is done being created, we can `cd` into. In order to view it live in our browser, we’ll run this command: `npm run serve`

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370470611_6.png?alt=media&token=9610951c-3e74-4ede-bae6-c5f3aca8d1d2)

Above is our app, running live in the browser. It already has two pages, the **Home** page and the **About** page, which you can navigate between because it’s using Vue Router.

---

## Vue UI

Now that we understand how to create a Vue project from the command line, let’s repeat this same process but with the Vue UI instead.

Since we now have access to the `vue` binary, we can type `vue ui` in our terminal, which will start up the Vue UI in our browser.

Our first step is to click the **Create** tab, select the location where we want to save our project, then click **Create a new project here**.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370470612_7.png?alt=media&token=6c77b1ab-ea85-436a-91b9-ab0af38264c3)

We’ll then give our project a name, in this case “real-world-vue”. We have the option to select a package manager, but we’ll stick with the default.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370474527_8.png?alt=media&token=4ef03d5c-aeb7-4ef4-bc4c-8e0ccf84ef1c)

Just like from the terminal, we’ll **Manually select features**.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370477481_9.png?alt=media&token=b2d6047e-dce4-419f-ab6a-3fe5591f6b6b)

We’ll select **Router**, **Vuex,** and make sure that **Babel** and **Linter / Formatter** are also selected and choose **Dedicated Config Files**.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370481194_10.png?alt=media&token=abc0ed7c-fadd-405c-ac6b-ae5271beaa51)

On the next page, we want to make sure **Lint on save** is selected, and in the right-hand dropdown, select **ESLint + Prettier**.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370484294_11.png?alt=media&token=63393292-e9d7-48ff-bcfa-e70d1c88b607)

We also have the option to save these settings as a preset, but we can choose not to by clicking **Continue without saving**.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370486491_12.png?alt=media&token=af9288c8-9171-4948-b6d6-5e145da34f73)

Now our project will be created.

## Vue UI Features

The UI provides the ability to alter our configurations, as well as run tasks, like the **serve** task that we ran earlier from the terminal. The difference here is that we get a lot more information about what is happening with that task.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370489057_13.png?alt=media&token=0f8ef762-f36f-40f6-9804-a0b18962d0eb)

You can also add **plugins** to your project from the Vue UI, which makes it very simple to add a library that you may need.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370491639_14.png?alt=media&token=3d43f3a3-757c-4ae7-9be5-662f69deada5)

If you need to import a project that you hadn’t originally created from the Vue UI, you can easily do so from the **Import** tab of the Project Manager. Just locate your project, and click **Import this folder**.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370495610_15.png?alt=media&token=5ed71c56-50c0-4068-89c8-be72b11e39c3)

## Touring our Vue Project

Now that we know how to create our project from the terminal and also from the UI, let’s take a look at the project that was created for us.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370500654_16.png?alt=media&token=66254760-a22f-41e6-a813-6488d864b868)

The **node\_modules** directory is where all of the libraries we need to build Vue are stored.

In the **public** directory, you place any static assets you don’t want to be run through Webpack when we build our project.

You’ll want to put the majority of your assets, such as images and fonts, in the **assets** directory so they can be optimized by Webpack.

The **components** directory is where we store the components, or building blocks, of our Vue app.

The **views** directory is where we store files for the different views, or pages, of our app.

The **App.vue** file is the root component that all other components are nested within.

The **main.js** file is what _renders_ our **App.vue** component (and everything nested within it) and _mounts_ it to the DOM.

Below that we have a **router.js** file, which we’ll cover more in the lesson on Vue Router, and the **store.js** file is for Vuex, which we’ll also cover in future lessons.

Finally, we have a **.gitignore** file where we can specify what we want git to ignore, along with a **babel.config.js** file and our **package.json**, which helps npm identify the project and handle its dependencies.

---

## How the App is Loaded

You might be wondering now, how is the app being loaded? Let’s take a look at that process.

```javascript
    import Vue from "vue";
    import App from "./App.vue";
    import router from "./router";
    import store from "./store";
    Vue.config.productionTip = false;
    new Vue({
      router,
      store,
      render: h => h(App)
    }).$mount("#app");

```

In our **main.js** file, we see that we’re importing Vue, along with our root **App.js** component, as well as our **router** and **store**. We are then creating a new Vue instance, telling it to use the **router** and **store**, and to _render_ `App` (our root component) and _mount_ it to the DOM, where this id of ``` "``app``" ``` is.

If we peek inside our Index.html file, we can see there’s a div with the id of `"app"`, which means this is where our `App` will be _mounted_.

```html
    <div id="app">Our App will be mounted here</div>

```

Let’s take a look at this process more visually:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370500655_17.gif?alt=media&token=f5b1a369-ca87-459b-923e-5a11d6dcaa44)

---

## The Build Process

Now that we understand how the App gets _rendered_ and _mounted_, let’s take a look at the build process. Because remember? Webpack will be bundling our files together.

If we take a closer look at our **Index.html** file, we see this comment:

```html
    <!-- built files will be auto injected -->

```

So what does that mean?

Let’s explore that by heading back to our terminal, and running the command `npm run build`. This will build our project, and when it’s complete, we see it says, “The dist directory is ready to be deployed”.

Hmm. Let’s open up the **dist** directory that was created for us.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578370504187_18.png?alt=media&token=cd926243-3f0e-40dd-9bac-549a8bc7cfe0)

As we see here in the **js** directory, Webpack has packaged our app and given us these new bundled JavaScript files.

And if we open up our **Index.html**, we can see that there are now two script tags, which have been auto injected, where that comment \*\*used to be _(“built files will be auto injected”)._

```hmtl
    <script src=/js/chunk-vendors.24971a46.js></script>
    <script src=/js/app.5f694b83.js></script>

```

The **chunk-vendors.24971a46.js** file contains all of our dependencies.

The **App.5f694b83.js** file below it contains all of our application-specific code, including the code that was in our **Main.js,** which _renders_ and _mounts_ our **App**.

So when our project is deployed, and the browser reads this **App.5f694b83.js** file, that will trigger the process we just looked at visually, where our Vue instance is created and our **App** is _rendered_ and then _mounted_ to the DOM.

## What’s next?

In the next lesson, we’ll be exploring how to set up our code editor for an optimal development environment.
