# Project Structure

In this lesson weâ€™ll be looking at the starting code for the example app weâ€™ll be using for this course. Weâ€™ll understand the steps that need to be taken to add authentication to it, which weâ€™ll do lesson by lesson throughout the course. We will be using Vue Router, Vuex, and Axios, so if you are not yet familiar with those topics, please take our [Real World Vue](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/real-world-vue-js/real-world-intro) and [Mastering Vuex](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/mastering-vuex/intro-to-vuex) courses, then meet me back here.

## Exploring the Starting Code

If youâ€™d like to code along during this course, you can download the starting code in the Lesson Resources located on this page. Once youâ€™re ready, weâ€™ll start in the **main.js** file.

ðŸ“ƒ**main.js**

```
    import Vue from 'vue'
    import App from './App.vue'
    import router from './router'
    import store from './store'
    
    Vue.config.productionTip = false
    
    new Vue({
      router,
      store, 
      render: h => h(App)
    }).$mount('#app')

```

Thereâ€™s nothing new here, but note that weâ€™re using Vue Router and Vuex (`router` and `store`).

---

Now letâ€™s look at the **App.vue** file.

ðŸ“ƒ**App.vue**

```
    <template>
      <div id="app">
        <app-nav />
        <router-view class="page" />
      </div>
    </template>
    <script>
    import AppNav from './components/AppNav'
    export default {
      components: { AppNav }
    }
    </script>
    <style lang="scss">
    @import './assets/styles/global.scss';
    .page {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      flex-direction: column;
      align-items: center;
      min-height: calc(100vh - 56px);
    }
    </style>

```

In the `style` section you can see weâ€™re importing a global stylesheet from our **assets** directory and have imported the **AppNav** component, which weâ€™re using in the template.

---

Now letâ€™s look at the **AppNav** component.

ðŸ“ƒ **src/components/AppNav.vue**

```
    <template>
      <div id="nav">
        <router-link to="/">
          Home
        </router-link>
        <router-link to="/dashboard">
          Dashboard
        </router-link>
      </div>
    </template>
    
    <script>
    export default {}
    </script>
    
    <style lang="scss" scoped>
    #nav {
      display: flex;
      align-items: center;
      min-height: 50px;
      padding: 0.2em 1em;
      background: linear-gradient(to right, #16c0b0, #84cf6a);
    }
    .nav-welcome {
      margin-left: auto;
      margin-right: 1rem;
      color: white;
    }
    a {
      font-weight: bold;
      color: #2c3e50;
      margin: auto 0.8em auto 0.4em;
      text-decoration: none;
      border-top: 2px solid transparent;
      border-bottom: 2px solid transparent;
    }
    .router-link-exact-active {
      color: white;
      border-bottom: 2px solid #fff;
    }
    button,
    .button {
      margin-left: auto;
      background: white;
      text-decoration: none;
      color: #2c3e50;
      &.router-link-active {
        color: #2c3e50;
      }
    }
    .logoutButton {
      cursor: pointer;
    }
    .nav-welcome + button {
      margin-left: 0;
    }
    </style>

```

This file simply has two `router-links` to our **views**, and some scoped styles.

---

Also in the **components** directory we have the **EventCard.vue** file, which weâ€™ve seen in previous courses.

ðŸ“ƒ **src/components/EventCard.vue**

```
    <template>
      <div class="event-card">
        <span>@{{ event.time }} on {{ event.date }}</span>
        <h4>{{ event.title }}</h4>
      </div>
    </template>
    <script>
    export default {
      name: 'EventCard',
      props: {
        event: {
          type: Object,
          default: () => {
            return {}
          }
        }
      }
    }
    </script>
    <style scoped>
    .event-card {
      width: 13em;
      margin: 1em auto 1em auto;
      padding: 1em;
      border: solid 1px #2c3e50;
      cursor: pointer;
      transition: all 0.2s linear;
    }
    .event-card:hover {
      transform: scale(1.01);
      box-shadow: 0 3px 12px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 1px 15px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);
    }
    .event-card h4 {
      font-size: 1.4em;
      margin-top: 0.5em;
      margin-bottom: 0.3em;
    }
    </style>

```

This component expects an `event` prop, which it displays in its template.

---

Now letâ€™s head into our **views** directory, where we have the **Dashboard.vue** and **Home.vue** files.

ðŸ“ƒ **src/views/Home.vue**

```
    <template>
      <div class="home">
        <h1>Welcome to the App!</h1>
      </div>
    </template>
    
    <script>
    export default {}
    </script>

```

The **Home** view is currently very simple, with just an `h1`. The **Dashboard** is where the action is happening.

ðŸ“ƒ **src/views/Dashboard.vue**

```
    <template>
      <div>
        <h1>Dashboard</h1>
        <template v-if="!isLoading">
          <EventCard v-for="event in events" :key="event.id" :event="event" />
        </template>
        <p v-else>
          Loading events
        </p>
      </div>
    </template>
    
    <script>
    import axios from 'axios'
    import EventCard from '../components/EventCard'
    export default {
      components: { EventCard },
      data () {
        return {
          isLoading: true,
          events: []
        }
      },
      created () {
        axios.get('//localhost:3000/dashboard').then(({ data }) => {
          this.events = data.events.events
          this.isLoading = false
        })
      }
    }
    </script>

```

Here, we are importing axios, and using it when the component is `created` to make a call out to our api, which returns a list of events. We then set the **Dashboard**â€™s component data equal to the response. We are also changing `isLoading` to `false`. We use the boolean value of `isLoading` in the template to determine whether to `v-for` through an **EventCard** for each event in our `events` data or to display a loading message instead.

---

If we look at our **router** file, we can see weâ€™re importing both **Home** and **Dashboard** and have a route for each of them, respectively.

ðŸ“ƒ**router.js**

```
    import Vue from 'vue'
    import Router from 'vue-router'
    import Home from './views/Home.vue'
    import Dashboard from './views/Dashboard.vue'
    Vue.use(Router)
    const router = new Router({
      mode: 'history',
      base: process.env.BASE_URL,
      routes: [
        {
          path: '/',
          name: 'home',
          component: Home
        },
        {
          path: '/dashboard',
          name: 'dashboard',
          component: Dashboard
        }
      ]
    })
    export default router

```

---

Peeking into our **store** file, weâ€™ll see itâ€™s currently blank.

ðŸ“ƒ **store.js**

```
    import Vue from 'vue'
    import Vuex from 'vuex'
    
    Vue.use(Vuex)
    
    export default new Vuex.Store({
      state: {},
      mutations: {},
      actions: {}
    })

```

Weâ€™ll be adding to Vuex as we build out the app.

---

Also, notice how we have a **server.js** file that makes use of the two files in our **db** directory. Our api will get events from the **events.json**, and weâ€™ll use the **user.json** file to register and log in users. Please know that this server-side code is a simple solution meant only for this course. The backend code is not meant for a real production-level application. This course focuses on how to develop an Vue.js authentication _front-end_, which should work with your backend solution of choice.

Finally, in the **package.json**, youâ€™ll see Iâ€™ve added a `start` script, which runs our server and builds our app. Weâ€™ll type `npm run start` in the terminal to get our project up and running.

---

## Understanding the Tasks Ahead

Now that we have explored the app, we can start adding authentication to it. But we need to take a step back and understand what steps weâ€™ll be taking to make that happen.

## Client/Server Communication

Weâ€™ll need to understand the communication that should happen between the client and our server. Our server has three api endpoints: `/register`, `/login`, and `/dashboard`.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578372619478_0.png?alt=media&token=04c13320-10e1-4688-9ed0-5b3bf6b71689)

Weâ€™ll call out to the `register` endpoint to register our users, then to the `login` endpoint to log in a registered user. Both of these actions causes the server to return a response that includes a JWT token, which we will send along with our requests to the `/dashboard` route, where our protected data (events) is returned.

So far so goodâ€¦ but there are three steps that need to be taken between logging a user in and requesting private data.

## Handling the Response

When a user registers or logs in, our server will return a response, which includes a JWT token along with the userâ€™s email and name.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578372619479_1.png?alt=media&token=d0fa22f0-2a2e-42c6-89d4-a3501255240b)

Weâ€™ll be using Vuex to do three things with that user data:

1. Store userData in Vuex State
2. Store userData in local storage (to persist it in case of browser refresh)
3. Add token to Axios header

Weâ€™ll also need to be logging out our user, which will reverse these steps.

---

## Whatâ€™s next?

Now that we have a foundational understanding of what token-based authentication is and the steps weâ€™ll take to implement it, we are ready to start building. In the next lesson, weâ€™ll add the ability to register users.
