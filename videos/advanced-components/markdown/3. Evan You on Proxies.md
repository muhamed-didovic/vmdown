# Evan You on Proxies

In the previous [video](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/advanced-components/build-a-reactivity-system/) we built out a reactivity system that mimics the Vue.js implementation of reactivity. The use of `Object.defineProperty()` to convert the properties into `getters/setters` allowed us to track them as dependencies when accessed and then rerun code (notify) when modified.

If you have been following the Vue [roadmap](https://github.com/vuejs/roadmap/blob/master/README.md), the [2.x-next](https://github.com/vuejs/roadmap/blob/master/README.md#2x-next) version’s reactivity system will be rewritten with Proxies, which is different than what I showed.

I wanted to ask Evan what exactly this might look like and the advantages we get from it.

## What are the Advantages?

The [proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/Proxy) API allows us to create a virtual representation of an object and provides us with handlers like `set()`, `get()` and `deleteProperty()` etc that we can use to intercept when properties are accessed or modified on the original object. This relieves us from the following limitations:

* Usage of `Vue.$set()` to add new reactive properties and `Vue.$delete()` to delete existing properties.
* [Array change detection](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/list.html#Caveats).

## Our Previous Code

Previously we used `Object.defineProperty()` to listen for when our properties are get and set. Here is [a codepen](https://codepen.io/GreggPollack/pen/xjoEOo) which shows where we ended up on the last lesson:

```javascript
    let data = { price: 5, quantity: 2 };
    let target = null;
    
    // Our simple Dep class
    class Dep {
      constructor() {
        this.subscribers = [];
      }
      depend() {
        if (target && !this.subscribers.includes(target)) {
          // Only if there is a target & it's not already subscribed
          this.subscribers.push(target);
        }
      }
      notify() {
        this.subscribers.forEach(sub => sub());
      }
    }
    
    // Go through each of our data properties
    Object.keys(data).forEach(key => {
      let internalValue = data[key];
    
      // Each property gets a dependency instance
      const dep = new Dep();
    
      Object.defineProperty(data, key, {
        get() {
          dep.depend(); // <-- Remember the target we're running
          return internalValue;
        },
        set(newVal) {
          internalValue = newVal;
          dep.notify(); // <-- Re-run stored functions
        }
      });
    });
    
    // The code to watch to listen for reactive properties
    function watcher(myFunc) {
      target = myFunc;
      target();
      target = null;
    }
    
    watcher(() => {
      data.total = data.price * data.quantity;
    });
    
    console.log("total = " + data.total)
    data.price = 20
    console.log("total = " + data.total)
    data.quantity = 10
    console.log("total = " + data.total)

```

## Solution: Using Proxy to overcome the limitations

Instead of looping through each property to add `getters/setters` we can set up a proxy on our `data` object using:

```javascript
    //data is our source object being observed
    const observedData = new Proxy(data, { 
      get() {
        //invoked when property from source data object is accessed
      },
      set() {
        //invoked when property from source data object is modified
      },
      deleteProperty() {
        //invoked when property from source data object is deleted
      }
    });

```

The second argument passed to `Proxy` constructor function is called the [handler](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/Proxy/handler). Handler is nothing but an object that contains functions known as traps. These traps allow us to intercept operations happening on the source `data` object.

The `get()` and `set()` are two traps that can be used to invoke `dep.depend()` and `dep.notify()` respectively. The `set()` trap will be invoked even for the newly added properties, so it can be it can be used to make new properties reactive. Hence, we no longer need to declare new reactive properties using `Vue.$set()`. The same applies for deletion of reactive properties which can be handled in `deleteProperty()` trap.

## Implementing the Reactivity System Using Proxies

Even though the Proxy API is not yet incorporated into Vue’s reactivity system, let’s try to implement the reactivity system from the previous lesson using Proxy ourselves. The first thing we’ll change is our `Object.keys(data).forEach` loop, which we’ll now use to create a new Dep for each reactive property.

```javascript
    let deps = new Map(); // Let's store all of our data's deps in a map
    Object.keys(data).forEach(key => {
      // Each property gets a dependency instance
      deps.set(key, new Dep());
    });

```

**Side Note:** The `Dep` class remains the same. Now we’ll replace the use of `Object.defineProperty` with the use of a proxy:

```javascript
    let data_without_proxy = data; // Save old data object
    data = new Proxy(data_without_proxy, {
      // Override data to have a proxy in the middle
      get(obj, key) {
        deps.get(key).depend(); // <-- Remember the target we're running
        return obj[key]; // call original data
      },
      set(obj, key, newVal) {
        obj[key] = newVal; // Set original data to new value
        deps.get(key).notify(); // <-- Re-run stored functions
        return true;
      }
    });

```

As you can see, we create a variable `data_without_proxy` that holds the copy of our source `data` object which will be used when overwriting the `data` object to have a `Proxy` object. The `get()` and `set()` traps are passed in as the properties to handler object which is the 2nd argument.

**get(obj, key)**This is the function that gets invoked when a property is accessed. It receives the original object i.e `data_without_proxy` as `obj` and the key of the property that is accessed. We call the `depend()` method of the specific `Dep` class associated to that particular property. At last the value related to that key is returned using `return obj[key]`.

**set(obj, key, newVal)**The first two arguments are the same as the above-mentioned `get()` trap. The 3rd argument is the new modified value. Then we set the new value to the property that is modified using `obj[key] = newVal` and call the `notify()` method.

## Moving Total & Testing

We need to make one more small change to our code. We need to extract `total` into its own variable as it does not need to be reactive.

```javascript
    let total = 0;
    watcher(() => {
      total = data.price * data.quantity;
    });
    console.log("total = " + total);
    data.price = 20;
    console.log("total = " + total);
    data.quantity = 10;
    console.log("total = " + total);

```

Now when we re-run the program, we see the following output in the console:

```javascript
    total = 10
    total = 40
    total = 200

```

That’s a good sign. The `total` updates when we update the `price` and `quantity`.

## Adding Reactive Properties

Now we should be able to add properties into `data` without declaring them upfront. That was one of the reasons for considering proxies over `getters/setters` right? Let’s try it out.

We can add the following code:

```javascript
    deps.set("discount", new Dep());  // Need a new dep for our property
    data["discount"] = 5; // Add our new property
    
    let salePrice = 0; 
    
    watcher(() => {  // New code to watch which includes our reactive property
      salePrice = data.price - data.discount;
    });
    
    console.log("salePrice = " + salePrice);
    data.discount = 7.5;  // This should be reactive, and rerun the watcher.
    console.log("salePrice = " + salePrice);

```

When the program is run we can see the following output:

```javascript
    ....
    salePrice = 15
    salePrice = 12.5

```

You can see that when the `data.discount` is modified the `salePrice` also gets updated. Hurray! The finished code can [be seen here](https://codepen.io/GreggPollack/pen/gKogaE).

## ReVue

In this lesson Evan You spoke to us about how future versions of Vue (v2.6-next) could implement reactivity using Proxies. We learned more about:

* The limitations of current reactivity system
* How proxies work
* How to build a reactivity system using proxies

In the next video, we’ll dive into the Vue source code and discover where reactivity lies.
