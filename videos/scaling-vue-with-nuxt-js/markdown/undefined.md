# Why Use Nuxt.js?

## 7 Problems you can avoid by using Nuxt.js for your next Vue app

Vue.js is a great choice as a framework for your application. But, there are a couple concerns you‚Äôll likely run into:

* How do I combine and configure all my JavaScript & Vue libraries to work together effectively?
* How do I structure my application code using best practices?
* How do I make sure my application is properly indexed by search engines?
* How do I optimize my Vue application for speed?

These are some of the concerns that Sebastien and Alexandre Chopin set out to solve when they created Nuxt.js, a higher-level framework that‚Äôs built _on top of_ Vue to help you build production-ready Vue applications.

I want to let you in 7 problems you‚Äôre going to run into building a Vue app, and tell you how Nuxt solves them.

### Problem #1: Building a production-ready Vue app from scratch is difficult

Not only does Nuxt come preconfigured with Vuex, Vue Router, and Vue-Meta, but it sets your project up with intelligent defaults based on well researched best practices that Vue won‚Äôt give you out of the box.

Creating a Nuxt app is as easy as typing:

This Nuxt Starter Kit will ask you for the libraries you want to start your project with, such as CSS Lint, and which CSS framework to use.

### Problem #2: No standard folder structure

As your application grows your code organization becomes more important. Vue‚Äôs default build gives you an **assets** and **components** directory, which is a good start. Nuxt.js sets you up with additional folders based on best practices, such as:

üìÇ A `pages` directory for your Application views and routes.

üìÇ A `layouts` directory for your layout templates.

üìÇ A `store` directory for your Vuex store files.

Nuxt ships with more folders and more default conventions which are all configurable, but you get the idea.

**Since everything has its place, moving from one Nuxt application to another as a developer and getting up to speed is super simple.**

---

### Problem #3: Routing configuration can get long in a big Vue app

With Nuxt, you simply place your single file Vue components into the pages folder and Nuxt automatically generates your routes with zero configuration.

This is just one more example of how Nuxt gives you the pre-configuration you need to create production-ready Vue applications. This leads us to the next problem with big applications‚Ä¶

### Problem #4: No standard way to configure things all together

Luckily, **Nuxt ships with a production ready configuration that doesn‚Äôt lock you in.** Meaning if you do you want to override any of the smart defaults or pre-configuration you can edit your nuxt.config.js file and modify any of the framework‚Äôs options.

### Problem #5: Vue apps aren‚Äôt not SEO-friendly

You‚Äôre going to want certain pages of your app properly indexed by search engines so they‚Äôre easily discoverable.

One of the best solutions is to pre-render your Vue pages on the server, but this can be tricky to setup on your own. Nuxt is pre-configured to generate your application on the server, along with powering up your routes to make it easy to add SEO-related tags.

---

### Problem #6: Vue applications on initial load can be slow

With Nuxt.js if you choose to render your application universally or statically, the pre-rendered HTML causes your page to load faster in the browser. Once it‚Äôs loaded, it‚Äôll start running as a normal SPA. Plus with automatic code-splitting it‚Äôs only going to load the JavaScript needed to make the route function.

This makes for the optimal user experience.

### Problem #7: With a Vue app you may find it difficult to change the behavior of the framework

When you are developing production-grade applications, at some point you‚Äôll need to change the behavior of the framework. Nuxt provides a **higher-order module system** that makes it easy to customize every aspect of Nuxt.
