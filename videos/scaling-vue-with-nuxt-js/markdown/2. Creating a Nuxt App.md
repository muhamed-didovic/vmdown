This course was created with Nuxt 2.3.4\. Please check the [Nuxt docs](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/get-started/installation) if you run into any issues using a newer version.

# Creating a Nuxt App

Now that you know [why to use Nuxt.js](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/scaling-vue-with-nuxt-js/why-use-nuxt) to build Vue apps, in this lesson we’ll start building a Nuxt.js app together, understand the folder structure, and start building our example application. By the end we’ll have a working app with a layout and two pages we can navigate between.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

From this point forward I’m going to assume that you’re comfortable with HTML, CSS, JavaScript basics, Vue.js, Vue Router, and Vuex. If you’re not familiar with these Vue topics, I recommend you stop here and take our [Real World Vue.js](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/real-world-vue-js/real-world-intro/) course and our [Mastering Vuex](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/mastering-vuex/intro-to-vuex) course.

## Creating our Initial Nuxt.js App

To get started creating our application we’ll be using `create-nuxt-app`. Create Nuxt App is a command line tool that helps you create and scaffold out your Nuxt applications. It helps you set up the default folder structure of your app, you can optionally install your preferred server-side framework like Express or Koa, and you can also install the Nuxt Axios module for easy Axios integration with your app.

To get started, make sure you’re using a version of npm that’s 5.2.0 or higher. This will ensure you have have `npx` installed, we’ll need this command.

Then let’s run the following in your command in the terminal:

```
    $ npx create-nuxt-app real-world-nuxt

```

**npx** is a tool intended to help round out the experience of using packages from the npm registry — the same way npm makes it easy to install and manage dependencies hosted on the registry, npx makes it easy to use CLI tools and other executables hosted on the registry. In our case, that’s `create-nuxt-app`.

If Yarn is your package manager of choice you can run `yarn create nuxt-app real-world-nuxt`. It’ll set you up in the same way.

After running either the `npx` or `yarn` command, Create Nuxt App will prompt you with a few questions to get you setup with your app’s default configuration.

Here is how we’re going to answer for our project, and I really encourage you to code with me.

It will also create a git repository for you, and run `npm install` to fetch all dependencies.

To run the app that was just created in development mode, we’ll need to `cd` into the directory it created for us run the following command:

```
    $ npm run dev 

```

This will startup our Nuxt.js server in development mode. By default, the project will serve from `http://localhost:3000/`. Visiting that URL will show you the scaffolded project with a link to Nuxt’s documentation.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578373049723_1.jpg?alt=media&token=6b32af1e-8d69-43d9-9b8c-822c4773323a)

This would be a good point to create our first git commit, and add a repo to github (or wherever you like to store your source code).

Now we’re in a good position to start building the events app. Before we get started, let’s go over the folder structure that was created for us by `create-nuxt-app`.

## What Vue (not Nuxt) Would Have Given Us

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578373059826_2.jpg?alt=media&token=6b46e41e-4136-4735-b7c5-dbf36878a106)

If we had created just a Vue application using the Vue CLI, it would given us just a `/src` directory and inside that a `components` directory. This leaves us with a few questions:

* Do we put all our components in one `/components` directory?
* Do we create a `/views` directory?
* Where do our layouts go? You know, the ones with `<router-view />`?

## The Nuxt.js Component Folder Structure

Open the project generated by `create-nuxt-app` in your code editor of choice, and you’ll see a list of folders where your entire Nuxt application will live. You’ll first notice that Nuxt.js has no `/src` directory, these folder are in root. Three of the eight folders there are the component folders:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578373061939_3.jpg?alt=media&token=2475f5b7-591f-46b9-9087-1aea19903af5)

Each of these folders will contain component `.vue` files, and they each start out with a single default generated file, which together showed us the page we saw when we launched the development server.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578373064141_4.jpg?alt=media&token=40f2e214-094f-4140-91aa-e35ac64a508f)

Here are the remaining five folders Nuxt generated for us.

## `/store`

A folder to contain all of your app’s Vuex Store Files. Nuxt gives you two different ways to create your store and we’ll dive deeper into how as the course progresses.

## `/static`

Use this directory for storing static assets. For example, `robots.txt` or your favicon. Every single file in this directory is mapped to the server root, usually at `/`.

## `/assets`

This directory contains un-compiled assets such as Stylus or Sass files, images, or fonts. By default, Nuxt uses vue-loader, file-loader and url-loader webpack loaders for strong assets serving. If you don’t want assets to be affected by webpack, use the `static` directory for storing those assets.

## `/plugins`

This folder contains your JavaScript plugins that you want to run before instantiating the root Vue.js Application. This directory is helpful when using your own libraries or Vue plugins.

## `/middleware`

Middleware lets you define custom functions that can be run before rendering either a page or a group of pages (layouts). This folder contains your application middleware for that purpose.

Finally, you’ll notice a configuration file called `nuxt.config.js`. We’ll get to this in a future lesson. But, for now, know that this is the single file that you’ll be using to write extra configuration, or to modify configuration that Nuxt sets up for your app by default.

Here’s a simple slide showing each of these:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578373066655_5.jpg?alt=media&token=c5fed040-8bc9-4bfe-8333-ac580c180fea)

## Image Assets Example

Usually we’ll want to place all our images in the `assets` directory where Nuxt will use vue-loader, file-loader, and url-loader for effective asset serving. For example, if we placed a `logo.png` file in our assets directory, to use this in a component template we would write:

📜 **/pages/index.vue**

```html
    <img src="~/assets/logo.png">

```

**When we build our project, if our image is >= 1 kb**, it will use version hashes for caching and render out:

```html
    <img src="/_nuxt/img/82f7965.png">

```

The `82f7965` is the hash we’re talking about. This is beneficial because if our `logo.png` file changes in the future, but the name itself remains the same, the hash will change, and thus the new logo will be loaded in our customer’s browsers. Without the change of hash our customer’s browser may continue to load the old image.

**When we build our project, if our image is < 1 kb** it will inline the image to reduce http requests, looking something like this:

```html
    <img src="data:image/png;base64,R0l...">

```

Obviously where I put `…` it would be a much longer string, which contains all the data for the image. By placing the image code right there on the screen, we avoid an extra network request to fetch the file.

## Creating our First Pages & Routes

In a minute we’re going to create our first two pages with links so we can navigate between them. We’ll create an `/pages/index.vue` where we’ll eventually list our events, and a `/pages/create.vue` where we’ll create an event list. Once we create these **do you think we’ll need to create a `router.js`?**

**Nope, Nuxt autogenerates the routes for us. We don’t need to write this code:**

```javascript
    const router = new Router({
     routes: [
        {
          path: '/',
          component: 'pages/index.vue'
        },
        {
          path: '/create',
          component: 'pages/create.vue'
        }
      ]
    })

```

---

## Steps to Build our Example App

We’ll be doing the following step by step:

1. Fix the settings in VS Code.
2. Copy/paste some global styles into our `/layout/default.vue`.
3. Simplify our `/pages/index.vue`.
4. Startup our development server and test.
5. Create `/pages/create.vue`.
6. Create a new component for navigation `/component/NavBar.vue`.
7. Use our NavBar component in our `/layout/default.vue`.

## Step 1 - Fixing Settings in VS Code

If you followed along with us in Real World Vue when we setup our **VS Code** for editing Vue projects, you may run into a conflict between Vetur’s Prettier HTML formatting and the ESLint formatting on our project. If you have the same problem that I did, you’ll want to go into **Preferences => Settings => Extensions => Vetur**, and change the default HTML formatter from **prettyhtml** to **none,** as shown below:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578373069503_6.jpg?alt=media&token=794779af-950e-4310-bebf-8432466c3699)

## Step 2 - Adding Styles into our /layout/default.vue

To start building our example app, we’re going to change our default layout to the following. Notice that we added an id to our `<div>` element, and a bunch of our own styles. You also might notice the `<nuxt />` tag, which is where our `/page` components get rendered. It behaves a lot like our `<router-view />`.

📜 **/layout/default.vue**

```html
    <template>
      <div id="app">
        <nuxt />
      </div>

    .field {
      margin-bottom: 24px;
    }
    .error {
      border: 1px solid red;
    }
    .errorMessage {
      color: red;
    }
    </style>

```

## Step 3 - Simplify /pages/index.vue

Next we’ll open our `/pages/index.vue` file which Vue created for us, delete everything we see there and replace it with:

📜 **/pages/index.vue**

```html
    <template>
      <div>
        <h1>Events</h1>
      </div>
    </template>

```

## Step 4 - Startup our Development Server and Test

Now let’s try out our code so far and make sure everything is working. We’ll make sure our development server is running `npm run dev`, and call up our browser. You should see on <http://localhost:3000/>

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578373075838_7.jpg?alt=media&token=35b7211e-2bff-45a0-8a7a-dc4021495ba3)

Wonderful!

## Step 5 - Create /pages/create.vue

We’re going to create our second page now, with the simple template code:

📜 **/pages/create.vue**

```html
    <template>
      <div>
        <h1>Create An Event</h1>
      </div>
    </template>

```

If we dive into our browser, we can indeed navigate to both pages even though we haven’t created or modified a `router.js` file. Nuxt.js is doing the routing for us.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578373078967_8.gif?alt=media&token=814cb6cb-acf1-4eb3-b1da-49067e7aa966)

## Step 6 - Create a NavBar Component for Navigation

Next, we’ll delete the `/component/Logo.vue` file that the Nuxt generator created for us, and create our own component. Notice that we’re using the `nuxt-link` to generate our links instead of `router-link`.

📜 **/component/NavBar.vue**

```html
    <template>
      <div class="nav">
        <nuxt-link to="/" class="brand">Real World Events</nuxt-link>
        <nav>
          <nuxt-link to="/">List</nuxt-link>&nbsp;|
          <nuxt-link to="/create">Create</nuxt-link>
        </nav>
      </div>
    </template>
    
    <style scoped>
    .brand {
      font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
      font-weight: 700;
      font-size: 1.5em;
      color: #39b982;
      text-decoration: none;
    }
    .nav {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: space-between;
      align-items: center;
      height: 60px;
    }
    .nav .nav-item {
      box-sizing: border-box;
      margin: 0 5px;
      color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
      text-decoration: none;
    }
    .nav .nav-item.router-link-exact-active {
      color: #39b982;
      border-bottom: solid 2px #39b982;
    }
    .nav a {
      display: inline-block;
    }
    </style>

```

Now we need to use this component inside our layout, just like we would include any other component.

📜 **/layouts/default.vue**

```html
    <template>
      <div id="app">
        <nav-bar/>
        <nuxt/>
      </div>
    </template>
    <script>
    import NavBar from "~/components/NavBar.vue";
    export default {
      components: {
        NavBar
      }
    };
    </script>
    <style>
      ...
    </style>

```

Now that we’ve made these changes we can jump into the browser and see our Nuxt application in action.

## ⏪ To Re-Vue

In this lesson we learned how to create a Nuxt.js project, about the different directories Nuxt.js creates for you, and how to start building page components and link them together. In the next lesson we’ll learn about Nuxt.js Universal mode and how server-side rendering helps our Vue apps scale.
