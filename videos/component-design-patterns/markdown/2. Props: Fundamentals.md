# Props: Fundamentals

## Introduction

When it comes to passing information down from one component to another, props are the first technique that most Vue developers encounter. By defining a `props` property on a component, it can then receive data.

## Defining Props: Best Practices

---

### The Array Syntax

---

When defining props, many developers are initially exposed to the Array syntax.

```html
<script>
export default {
  name: 'Movie',
  props: ['title', 'length', 'watched']
}
</script>

```

```html
<template>
	<section>
		<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
		<p>{{ length }} <span v-if="watched">‚úÖ</span><p>
	</section>
</template>

```

While there is nothing wrong with this definition and will work in production, there are some pitfalls that exists with this method:

* Although the prop names may seem intuitive based on its meaning, it leaves it open for interpretation which can often lead to bugs
* For example, what happens when a developer forgets to include a prop that is technically required for the component to render properly? A Movie component without a title would look rather silly wouldn‚Äôt it?
* Another issue that arises is that the definition of each prop is vague. In the example we have above, should `length` be a number? Should it be a formatted string (i.e., `1:28`)? But then which format should it be (i.e., `1 hr 28 min`)
* And when registering whether the movie has been watched before, what‚Äôs the proper way to tell it‚Äôs been watched (e.g., Yes? Y? Watched? true?)

Let‚Äôs not forget that this component is only responsible for rendering the props. Can you imagine what kind of bugs would show up if more complex logic was involved? üò±

### The Object Syntax

---

Instead, for most scenarios, we should define our props using the Object syntax. This allows us to define three key prop attributes that allow you to answer three fundamental questions:

* `type`: What data type(s) can be expected?
* `required`: Is the prop is required or not
* `default`: Is there default content that accounts for most scenarios so we don‚Äôt have to repeat ourselves multiple time?

```html
<script>
export default {
	props: {
		length: {
			type: Number,
			required: true,
			default: 90
		}
	}
}
</script>

```

While you are probably aware of some of the basic JavaScript data types:

* String
* Number
* Boolean
* Array
* Object

There are a few more that you should know about!

* Date
* Function
* Symbols

And if you want to define multiple data types, it‚Äôs as simple as using an Array syntax!

```html
<script>
export default {
	props: {
		length: {
			type: [Number, String],
			required: true,
			default: 90
		}
	}
}
</script>

```

Some of you might also be thinking, ‚ÄúIf there is a `default` property defined, is a `required` property really needed?‚Äù And you‚Äôd be right! The reality is that when you have a default prop, you don‚Äôt need the required prop.

```html
<script>
export default {
	props: {
		length: {
			type: Number,
			default: 90
		}
	}
}
</script>

```

### Conclusion

---

To review, the Array syntax methodology can be prone to bugs as the application scales, but this is a completely valid method that can be very useful when prototyping and such. However, whenever possible, it‚Äôs considered a best practice to define your props using the Object syntax.

Finally, when defining your props, remember to answer the three fundamental questions:

* What data type(s) can be expected?
* Is the prop required?
* Can you provide default data to account for most scenario?

Remember that props are useful for providing detailed specifications on how to use a component, but this is also it‚Äôs downside as this does not allow flexibility on the developer‚Äôs part.
