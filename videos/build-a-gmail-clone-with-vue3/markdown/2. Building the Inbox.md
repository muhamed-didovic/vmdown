# Building the Inbox

For the starting code for this lesson, switch to branch: <https://github.com/Code-Pop/build-gmail-clone-with-vue-3/tree/video-2-start>

## What we‚Äôll be doing

This lesson builds up the basic display of the inbox screen, re-introducing concepts from Vue 2 and showing that the Options API still works in a Vue 3 app.

We‚Äôll display emails as a table, mark emails as read when they‚Äôre clicked, display dates properly, sort and filter the emails, and add an archive button.

If you want to code along, you can download the starter code from <https://github.com/Code-Pop/build-gmail-clone-with-vue-3> and use the `video-2-start` branch. The finished code is in the `video-2-end` branch. This code includes some CSS, data, and packages that aren‚Äôt included with the standard VueCLI output.

## Updating VSCode‚Äôs Vetur for Vue 3

In Vue 3 we can have multiple root tags. However, currently this shows up as an ESLint error.

To fix this, go to Code > Preferences > Settings, search for ESLint, and uncheck ‚ÄúValidate vue-html in `<template>` using eslint-plugin-vue‚Äù.

## Creating the Email Table

We‚Äôll loop through the emails and put them in a table.

We‚Äôll show a checkbox, a ‚Äòfrom‚Äô field, a field that contains the subject and the first part of the email body, and then a date.

We‚Äôll be using hard-coded data for the emails for now.

```html
<div id="app">
  <h1>VMail Inbox</h1>
  
  <table class="mail-table">
    <tbody>
      <tr v-for="email in emails" 
          :key="email.id"
          class="clickable">
        <td>
          <input type="checkbox" />
        </td>
        <td>{{email.from}}</td>
        <td>
          <p><strong>{{email.subject}}</strong> - {{email.body}}</p>
        </td>
        <td class="date">{{email.sentAt)}}</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

```

```javascript
export default {
  name: 'App',
  data(){
    return {
      emails: [
        {
          "id": 1,

## Adding dynamic classes and click events

Let‚Äôs add some old standby Vue 2 techniques.

We‚Äôll add dynamic elements to the classes, using a dynamic class array and a click event. Read emails will display with a grey background.

```html
<tr v-for="email in emails" 
    :key="email.id"
    :class="[email.read ? 'read': '', 'clickable']"
    @click="email.read = true">

```

---

## Formatting dates

Then we‚Äôll use the date-fns library to make the date display better. Date-fns is like a lightweight moment.js.

```javascript
import { format } from 'date-fns';

export default {
  name: 'App',
  data(){
		let emails = [...]
    return {
      format,
      emails
		}
	}
}

```

```html
<td class="date">{{format(new Date(email.sentAt), 'MMM do yyyy')}}</td>

```

---

## Sorting and filtering

Then we‚Äôll sort and filter our data using computed properties.

We‚Äôll want it so that the most recently received emails are shown first. We‚Äôll also want archived emails to not display.

```javascript
computed: {
  unarchivedEmails(){
    return this.sortedEmails.filter(e => !e.archived)
  },
  sortedEmails(){
    return this.emails.sort((e1, e2) => {
      return e1.sentAt < e2.sentAt ? 1 : -1
    })
  }
}

```

```html
<tr v-for="email in unarchivedEmail" 
    :key="email.id"
    :class="[email.read ? 'read': '', 'clickable']"
    @click="email.read = true">

```

---

## Archive Button

Finally, we‚Äôll add an archive button, so we can remove emails from our inbox.

```html
<td><button @click="email.archived = true">Archive</button></td>

```

---

## Conclusion

So we‚Äôve built a nice basic Vue 3 app using just the techniques we know from Vue 2‚Ä¶ but in the upcoming lessons we‚Äôre going to take advantage of new Vue 3 features to make our app even better.
