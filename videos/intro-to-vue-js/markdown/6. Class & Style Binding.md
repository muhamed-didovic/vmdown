# Class & Style Binding

In this lesson we’ll be learning how to dynamically style our HTML by binding data to an element’s style attribute, as well as its class.

## Goal

Our first goal in this lesson is to use our variant colors to style the `background-color` of divs. Since our variant colors are “green” and “blue”, we want a div with a green `background-color` and a div with a blue `background-color`.

## Starting Code

## Problem

In the previous lesson, we created an event handler that updates the product’s image based on which `p` tag was hovered on. Instead of printing out the variant’s color into a `p` tag, we want to use that color to set the style of a div’s `background-color`. That way, instead of hovering over text in a `p` tag, we can hover over colored squares, which would update the product’s image to match the color that was hovered on.

---

## Solution

First, let’s add a class of `color-box` to our `div`, which gives it a width, height and margin. Since we’re still printing out “green” and “blue” onto the page, we can make use of those variant color strings and bind them to our style attribute, like so:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578366050177_2.png?alt=media&token=b8513f71-e9ad-498c-821b-5a87be8c02ed)

We are using an inline style to dynamically set the `background-color` of our divs, based on our variant colors ( `variant.variantColor` ).

Now that our `div`s are being styled by the `variantColor`, we no longer need to print them out. So we can delete the `p` tag and move its `@mouseover` into the `div` itself.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578366054944_3.png?alt=media&token=80578948-a2af-4f92-a8fc-dd3f70e3454f)

Now when we hover over the blue box and the blue socks appear, hover over the green box and the green socks appear. Pretty neat!

Now that we’ve learned how to do style binding, let’s explore class binding.

## Problem

Currently, we have this in our data:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578366060422_4.png?alt=media&token=1c796222-ec7b-47f5-bae2-b8b4310b0e9d)

When this boolean is `false`, we shouldn’t allow users to click the “Add to Cart” button, since there is no product in stock to add to the cart. Fortunately, there’s a built-in HTML attribute, `disabled`, which will disable the button.

As we learned in our second lesson in this series, we can use attribute binding to add the `disabled` attribute whenever `inStock` is false, or rather _not true_: `!inStock`.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578366063603_5.png?alt=media&token=154fe8bd-caaa-496a-b2db-cfa03eecb7ee)

Now our button is disabled whenever `inStock` is `false`. But that doesn’t change the appearance of the button. In other words, the button still appears clickable, even though it’s not.

---

## Solution

In a similar way to how we just bound `inStock` to the button’s `disabled` attribute, we can bind a `disabledButton` class to our button whenever `inStock` is false. That way, our button will also _appear_ disabled.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578366063604_6.png?alt=media&token=e2d8acae-703b-4374-b98a-2d5e181e434f)

It works! The button is now grayed out when `inStock = false`.

Let’s break this down.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578366067323_7.png?alt=media&token=133e19c8-98e2-4d42-84ad-56dc4d44b371)

We’re using the `v-bind` directive’s shorthand `:` to bind to our button’s `class`. Inside the brackets we’re determining the presence of the `disabled-button` class by the truthiness of the data property `inStock`.

In other words, when our product is not in stock ( `!inStock` ), the `disabledButton` class is added. Since the `disabled-button` class applies a gray `background-color`, the button turns gray.

Great! We’ve combined our new skill **class binding** with attribute binding to disable our button and turn it gray whenever our product `inStock` is false.

## What’d we learn

* Data can be bound to an element’s `style` attribute
* Data can be bound to an element’s `class`
* We can use expressions inside an element’s class binding to evaluate whether a class should appear or not

## What else should we know?

* You can bind an entire class object or array of classes to an element![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578366071703_8.png?alt=media&token=7c097480-d2a2-4a50-9437-5e69d2c22679)

## Learn by doing

### Challenge:

When `inStock` is false, bind a class to the “Out of Stock” `p` tag that adds `text-decoration: line-through` to that element.
