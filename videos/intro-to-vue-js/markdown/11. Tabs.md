# Tabs

In this lesson, we’ll learn how to add tabs to our application and implement a simple solution for global event communication.

## Goal

We’ll learn how to create tabs to display our reviews and our review form separately.

## Starting Code

**index.html**

```html
    <div id="app">
      <div class="cart">
        <p>Cart({{ cart.length }})</p>
      </div>
      <product :premium="premium" @add-to-cart="updateCart"></product>
    </div> 

```

**main.js**

```javascript
    Vue.component('product', {
        props: {
          premium: {
            type: Boolean,
            required: true
          }
        },
        template: `
         <div class="product">

## Problem

Currently in our project, we’re displaying our reviews and the form that is used to submit a review on top of each other. This works for now, but if our page needs to display more and more content, we’ll want the option to conditionally display content, based on user behavior.

---

## Solution

We can implement tabs so when we click on the **Reviews** tab, our reviews are shown, and when we click on the **Add a Review** tab, our form is shown.

---

## Creating a Tabs Component

We’ll start by creating a `product-tabs` component, which will be nested at the bottom of our `product` component.

```javascript
    Vue.component('product-tabs', {
      template: `
        <div>
          <span class="tab" v-for="(tab, index) in tabs" :key="index">{{ tab }}</span>
        </div>
      `,
      data() {
        return {
          tabs: ['Reviews', 'Make a Review']      
        }
      }
    })

```

We’ll add to this component soon, but so far this is what’s happening:

In our data, we have a `tabs` array with strings that we’re using as the titles for each tab. In the template, we’re using `v-for` to create a `span` for each string from our `tabs` array.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578365204252_0.png?alt=media&token=ec62f738-4cec-425b-93f1-75384643fe0a)

We want to know which tab is currently selected, so in our data we’ll add `selectedTab` and dynamically set that value with an event handler, setting it equal to the tab that was just clicked, with:

```javascript
    @click="selectedTab = tab"

```

So if we click the “Reviews” tab, then `selectedTab` will be “Reviews”. If we click the “Make a Review” tab, `selectedTab` will be “Make a Review”.

```javascript
    Vue.component('product-tabs', {
      template: `
        <div>    
          <ul>
            <span class="tab" 
                  v-for="(tab, index) in tabs" 
                  @click="selectedTab = tab" // sets value of selectedTab in data
            >{{ tab }}</span>
          </ul> 
        </div>
      `,
      data() {
        return {
          tabs: ['Reviews', 'Make a Review'],
          selectedTab: 'Reviews'  // set from @click
        }
      }
    })

```

## Class Binding for Active Tab

We should give the user some visual feedback so they know which tab is selected.

We can do this quickly by adding this [class binding](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-js/class-&-style-binding) to our span:

```javascript
    :class="{ activeTab: selectedTab === tab }"

```

This translates to: apply our `activeTab` class whenever it is true that `selectedTab` is equal to `tab`. Because `selectedTab` is always equal to whichever `tab` was just clicked, then this class will be applied to the tab the user clicked on.

In other words, when the first tab is clicked, `selectedTab` will be “Reviews” and the `tab` will be “Reviews”. So the `activeTab` class will be applied since they are equivalent.

Great! It works.

## Adding to our Template

Now that we’re able to know which tab was selected, we can build out our template and add the content we want to display when either tab is clicked.

What do we want to show up if we click on “Reviews”? Our reviews. So we’ll move that code from where it lives on our `product` component and paste it into the template of our `product-tabs` component, below our unordered list.

```javascript
    template: `
          <div>
          
            <div>
              <span class="tab" 
                    v-for="(tab, index) in tabs"
                    @click="selectedTab = tab"
              >{{ tab }}</span>
            </div>
            
            <div> // moved here from where it was on product component
                <p v-if="!reviews.length">There are no reviews yet.</p>
                <ul v-else>
                    <li v-for="(review, index) in reviews" :key="index">
                      <p>{{ review.name }}</p>
                      <p>Rating:{{ review.rating }}</p>
                      <p>{{ review.review }}</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
          </div>
    `

```

Notice, we’ve deleted the `h2` since we no longer need to say “Reviews” since that is the title of our tab.

But since `reviews` lives on our `product` component, we’ll need to send that data into our `product-tabs` component via props.

So we’ll add the prop we expect to receive on our `product-tabs` component:

```javascript
    props: {
      reviews: {
        type: Array,
        required: false
      }
    }

```

And pass in `reviews` on our `product-tabs` component itself, so it is always receiving the latest `reviews`.

```javascript
    <product-tabs :reviews="reviews"></product-tabs>

```

Now, what do we want to show when we click on the “Make a Review” tab? The review form.

So we’ll move the `product-review` component from where it lives within the `product` component and place it in the template of our `tabs` component, below the div for reviews that we just added.

```javascript
    <div>
      <product-review @review-submitted="addReview"></product-review>
    </div>

```

## Conditionally Displaying with Tabs

Now that we have our template set up, we want to conditionally display either the reviews div or the review form div, depending on which tab is clicked.

Since we are already storing the `selectedTab`, we can use that with `v-show` to conditionally display either tab. So whichever tab is selected, we’ll show the content for that tab.

We can add `v-show="selectedTab === 'Reviews'"` to our reviews div, and that div will display whenever we click the first tab. Similarly we can say `v-show="selectedTab === 'Make a Review'"` to display the second tab.

Now our template looks like this:

```javascript
    template: `
          <div>
          
            <div>
              <span class="tab" 
                    v-for="(tab, index) in tabs"
                    @click="selectedTab = index"
              >{{ tab }}</span>
            </div>
            
            <div v-show="selectedTab === 'Review'"> // displays when "Reviews" is clicked
                <p v-if="!reviews.length">There are no reviews yet.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li v-for="review in reviews">
                      <p>{{ review.name }}</p>
                      <p>Rating:{{ review.rating }}</p>
                      <p>{{ review.review }}</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div v-show="selectedTab === 'Make a Review'"> // displays when "Make a Review" is clicked
              <product-review @review-submitted="addReview"></product-review>        
            </div>
        
          </div>
    `

```

---

## The form can’t trigger `addReview`

We are now able to click on a tab and display the content we want, and even dynamically style the tab that is currently selected. But if you look in the console, you’ll find this warning:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1578365211163_2.png?alt=media&token=572a6c2f-cc80-463b-85ab-79aec0db24db)

So what’s going on with our `addReview` method?

This is a method that lives on our `product` component. And it’s supposed to be triggered when our `product-review` component (which is a child of `product`) emits the `review-submitted` event.

```javascript
    <product-review @review-submitted="addReview"></product-review>

```

But now our `product-review` component is a child of our `tabs` component, which is a child of the `product` component. In other words, `product-review` is now a _grandchild_ of `product`.

Our code is currently designed to have our `product-review` component communicate with its parent, but it’s parent is no longer the `product` component. So we need to refactor to make this event communication happen successfully.

## Refactoring Our Code

A common solution for communicating from a grandchild up to a grandparent, or for communicating between components, is to use what’s called a global event bus.

This is essentially a channel through which you can send information amongst your components, and it’s just a Vue instance, without any options passed into it. Let’s create our event bus now.

```javascript
    var eventBus = new Vue()

```

If it helps, just imagine this as a literal bus, and its passengers are whatever you’re sending at the time. In our case, we want to send an event emission. We’ll use this bus to communicate from our `product-review` component and let our `product` component know the form was submitted, and pass the form’s data up to `product`.

In our `product-review` component, instead of saying:

```javascript
    this.$emit('review-submitted', productReview)

```

We’ll instead use the `eventBus` to emit the event, along with its payload: `productReview`.

```javascript
    eventBus.$emit('review-submitted', productReview)

```

Now, we no longer need to listen for the `review-submitted` event on our product-review component, so we’ll remove that.

```javascript
    <product-review></product-review>

```

Now, in our `product` component, we can delete our `addReview` method and instead we’ll listen for that event using this code:

```javascript
    eventBus.$on('review-submitted', productReview => {
      this.reviews.push(productReview)
    })

```

This essentially says: when the `eventBus` emits the `review-submitted` event, take its payload (the `productReview`) and push it into `product`'s `reviews` array. This is very similar to what we were doing before with our `addReview` method.

## Why the ES6 Syntax?

We’re using the ES6 [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow%5Ffunctions) syntax here because an arrow function is bound to its parent’s context. In other words, when we say `this` inside the function, it refers to `this` component/instance. You can write this code without an arrow function, you’ll just have to manually bind the component’s `this` to that function, like so:

```javascript
    eventBus.$on('review-submitted', function (productReview) {
      this.reviews.push(productReview)
    }.bind(this))

```

## Final Step

We’re almost done. All that’s left to do is to put this code somewhere, like in `mounted`.

```javascript
    mounted() {
      eventBus.$on('review-submitted', productReview => {
        this.reviews.push(productReview)
      })
    }

```

What’s `mounted`? That’s a [lifecycle hook](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/instance.html#Instance-Lifecycle-Hooks), which is a function that is called once the component has mounted to the DOM. Now, once `product` has mounted, it will be listening for the `review-submitted` event. And once it hears it, it’ll add the new `productReview` to its data.

We’ll learn more about lifecycle hooks in our [Real World Vue](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses) course.

## A Better Solution

Using an event bus is a common solution and you may see it in others’ Vue code, but please be aware this isn’t the best solution for communicating amongst components within your app.

As your app grows, you’ll want to implement Vue’s own state management solution: [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/intro.html). This is a state-management pattern and library. You’ll also learn all about Vuex in our [Mastering Vuex](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses) course, where we’ll teach you how to build a production-level apps that can scale, from setting up your project using the Vue CLI all the way to deployment.
